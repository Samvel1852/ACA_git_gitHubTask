**Description of the task**

The task is about the usage of the Git and GitHub. There are many commands and working tools in Git. We have used some of them.
The used commands list are.
```
<ul>
    <li>mkdir (creates new directory (folder))</li>
    <li>cd (changes working directory)</li>
    <li>touch (creates new file)</li>
    <li>rmdir (removes the directory)</li>
    <li>rm (removes the file)</li>
    <li>ls (shows the list of the existing files)</li>
    <li>git init (init local git repo)</li>
    <li>git config</li>
    <li>git status etc.</li>
</ul>
```

```javascript
const sum = () => 12 + 12
```
**all these techniques are used for version control system**

Here is created also the GitHub repo for the usage of git.

#### GitHub repository

GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.
